Introduction
============

The Indian localization has been improved and extended in Odoo v15. In this version, the next modules are available:

- **l10n_in:** Adds accounting features for the Indian localization, which represent the minimal
  configuration required for a company to operate in India. The main elements included in this module are two formats of Chart of Accounts i.e Indian Chart Of Accounts - Standard and Indian Chart Of Accounts - Schedule VI.

- **l10n_in_edi:** Includes all technical and functional requirements to submit invoicing
  through API to the government.

Configuration
=============

Install the Indian localization modules
----------------------------------------

For this, go to *Apps* and search for ``l10n_in``. Then click *Install* in the module **Indian - E-invoicing**. This module has a dependency with **Indian - Accounting**. In case this last
one is not installed, Odoo installs it automatically with E-invoicing.

Workflows
=========

Electronic invoicing
--------------------

To start invoicing from Odoo, an invoice must be created using the standard invoicing flow.
That is either from a sales order or an invoice menu in the Accounting application.

The invoice will be posted after clicking on *Confirm*, before that the status is still in draft
mode and changes can be made to it. After validating the invoice, you can verify that it was
successfully posted, as it would look like this:
